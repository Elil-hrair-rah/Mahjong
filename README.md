# Mahjong
Python program to play games of Mahjong, for future ML applications and Discord bots. Uses [this](https://github.com/watterle/majsoul-generator) image generator, based off [this](https://github.com/Neutralization/majsoul-generator). It also calculates scores using the [mahjong library](https://github.com/MahjongRepository/mahjong).

Download program and execute `python majbot.py`.

Requires `discord.py` and `aio_timers`, and probably some other stuff that I forgot.

`m!help` brings up the command menu in discord, and the main functions to be used are `m!game` and `m!bot_game` at the moment.

Changelog can be found in `majbot.py`, or by typing command `m!changelog` while the bot is active.
